> **Backstory.** Skipped college after a Google engineer sponsored a **$100k independent research grant**; relocated to SF to do AI research full-time.

- **Head of Research, AGI, Inc.** Trained a computer-use agent ranked **#1 on OSWorld & AndroidWorld**; first **superhuman** on both. [[OSWorld benchmark]](https://os-world.github.io/#benchmark) · [[AndroidWorld leaderboard]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cchzP9dlTZ3WXQTfYNhh3avxoLipqHN75v1Tb86uhHo/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

- **Created [RealEvals.xyz](https://realevals.xyz).** Realistic mini-internet for training & evaluating web agents (benchmark + RL envs). Used internally by leading AI labs to train their models.

- **MATS — Mechanistic Interpretability Fellow.** Produced mech-interp analysis techniques **used internally at OpenAI**. [[Scaling Sparse Feature Circuit Finding]](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PkeB4TLxgaNnSmddg/scaling-sparse-feature-circuit-finding-to-gemma-9b)

- **Winner — Anthropic × Pear.** **SHIELD:** RL-trained coding agent that finds & fixes vulnerabilities; trained **Llama** to exceed **GPT-4** on a public vuln-finding/fixing dataset.

- **Winner — Anthropic × AGI House.** **MCP auto-trainer:** Trains any model to use any MCP. scrapes MCP servers, autogenerates tasks; **GRPO + LLM-as-judge** teaches small OSS LLMs to use any MCP.

- **Winner — WeaveHacks 2 ($12k).** **Daydreamer:** developed a novel way to turn **YouTube-scale video data directly into robot policies, solving robotics’ data problem**; video-diffusion **dream → pose → execute** loop; self-trains with VLM feedback.
